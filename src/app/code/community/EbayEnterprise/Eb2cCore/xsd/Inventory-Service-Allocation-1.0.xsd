        The allocation operation should be called immediately after the shopping 
        user acts to submit a new order.
        The operation is used to reserve inventory for a customer order.
        This allocation operation is executed separately from order create so 
        that inventory can be reserved to a shopping session while the sometimes
        lengthy process of creating the new order is transacted and a competing 
        shopper session doesn't get the inventory first.  This practice also 
        helps prevent over-selling high velocity items.

        <p>
        This type defines the syntax of a request message sent to the 
        inventory allocation API.  This request requires:
        <ul>
        <li>A reservation identifier which is used to identify the reservation
        created by this request to the backing order management system.  
        This identifier must be universally unique</li>
        <li>A request identifier which is used by the service to protect
        against duplicate request submissions.  This identifier must be
        universally unique.</li>
        <li>One or more order items</li>

                    This xsd:any element indicates that future optional elements may show up in this location of the XML document in the
                    responses returned from the service.
                    The purpose of this xsd:any element is to define a more robust service interface that allows for new, optional elements to be added
                    to the service's responses without the service clients' code throwing exceptions.
                    The client code for this service call should be written to not break if new optional XML elements show up in this part
                    of the service response.  Modern XML marshalling frameworks often process xsd:any elements properly out-of-the-box
                    (for example, in Java, JAXB and JibX XML marshalling frameworks both honor xsd:any elements and don't throw exceptions
                    if new optional elements appear within the xsd:any section of the XML document).
                    Developers' unit tests of their service client code should include a test case where this reply message
                    contains one or more new elements in this location of the XML document.
                    If new optional elements are added to this interface, a new schema will be created, communications will be sent out,
                    and you will have the option to modify your service client code to process and use the new elements.
                    If there is no need/desire to process the new optional elements, your service client should continue to run
                    uninterrupted as long as it is built to honor this xsd:any element.
